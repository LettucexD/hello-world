# hello-world
My First Project

Hi everyone! The name's Lexus.

I'm aspiring to be a coder who only has minimal coding knowledge so far. One of my mate's who is in a full time job as a coder recommended me to check this site out. I'm excited to find value in my learning experience by using this website. I am still very new to coding and have been using freecodecamp to teach myself how to code. I also applied for a coding bootcamp in hopes that it can help me accelerate my learning and help me kickstart a career in the real world!
